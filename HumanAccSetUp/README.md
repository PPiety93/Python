This project was my final project for my class in Introduction to Scripting at Bellevue College. The assignment was to build a program using Python and a CSV file for a Human Mission to Mars Account Setup system. Build a menu system with the following functions:

<ul>
  <li> Create a function to add a new human account using inputs. </li>
  <li>Create a function to list all human's names, their email addresses, age, gender, and their designated living pod room number. </li>
  <li>Create a search function to search for a human by last name. Then list all of the matches of the last name, first name, and their designated living pod room number. </li>
  <li>Create a living pod search that shows how many humans are assigned to each pod and how many spaces are still available. </li>
  <li>Create a function to display an administrator human population report that lists the account information for all human users - showing id number, first/last name, email and password. Require that an admin password is input before processing this request (PW: Admin123*) </li>
  <li>Create a delete function that will allow the user to delete a human from the system.</li>

</ul>
