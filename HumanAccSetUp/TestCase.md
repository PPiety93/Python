INPUTS -       Expected Output -  Actual Output - Notes 
firstname = " "    string           " "           I fixed it doing a while loop and addind the strip element, that way all the spaces will be delete and only a name can be writedown. 

AGE:
asdasd            error            asdasd       It was saving the information as string in the age column, so I check the input if it is numeric, if so, can be saved. otherwise It has to enter a valid number. 

GENDER:
a1235             error             a1235       It was saving the information but it wasn't the right information. So, I did a while loop that way the user has only two options F or M.
